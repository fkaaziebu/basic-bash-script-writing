# Basic Bash Proficiency

## Problem Description
In this exercise, I have been tasked to write bash scripts in a bash file.

The task basically wants me to unpack multiple packed (aka archives) files, including traversing folders recursively and unpack all archives in them

## Approach
1. Create the bash file with the name `unpack.sh`
2. Add a Shebang Line at the top of the file
```bash
#1/bin/bash
```
3. Write script to traverse folders and unpack packed files
4. Make script executable using the following command below using `the command line`. Make sure you are in the folder where the script is in.
```bash
# This code adds execute permissions to the script
chmod +x unpack.sh
```
5. Run the script using the command below in the command line
```bash
./unpack.sh
```
